                                        CREATING VIRTUAL SERVER USING EC2 IN AWS
Virtual Sever
-------------

A virtual server is a software-based server that operates on a physical server, enabling multiple virtual servers to share the same hardware
while running independently with their own operating systems and applications. This approach maximizes resource use and flexibility.

EC2
---
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a scalable cloud computing service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to launch and
manage virtual servers, known as INSTANCES, on-demand. EC2 provides flexible computing capacity, enabling users to scale resources up or down 
based on their needs, and only pay for what they use.

Step 1 : Sign Up into AWS Account
---------------------------------
Sign Up into AWS Account Search for EC2 services and you will reach the EC2 dashboard and click on Instances on the left to create an Instance.

Step 2 : Creating an instance
-----------------------------
Click on Launch Instances to create an Instance
you will be directed to Launch an Instance . create Name and Tag(optional) for your Instance.

Step 3 : Choosing AMI ( Amazon Machine Image )
----------------------------------------------
An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch your instance.
We will be using Ubuntu for creating Instance in this module

Step 4 : Choosing Instance Type
-------------------------------
Instance Type : When you launch an instance, the instance type that you specify determines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance. 
Each instance type offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities, and is grouped in an instance family based on these capabilities. 
Select an instance type based on the requirements of the application or software that you plan to run on your instance.
