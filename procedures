                                        CREATING VIRTUAL SERVER USING EC2 IN AWS
Virtual Sever
-------------

A virtual server is a software-based server that operates on a physical server, enabling multiple virtual servers to share the same hardware
while running independently with their own operating systems and applications. This approach maximizes resource use and flexibility.

EC2
---

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a scalable cloud computing service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to launch and
manage virtual servers, known as INSTANCES, on-demand. EC2 provides flexible computing capacity, enabling users to scale resources up or down 
based on their needs, and only pay for what they use.
